# MDB
modern database :)

A modern database based on sql

### Purpose
Learning multiple ways to use databases is annoying and a waste of time

The aim of MDB is to imitate the ways of sql but for json as sql is easier to understand in .sql files

This is because it looks something like this

```sql
SELECT x
FROM example;
```

Meanwhile MDB

```
SELECT hello
FROM example
```

To show the database in json simply add

```
SELECT hello
FROM example
SHOW
```
Leave blank for the most previously defined FROM to show

### TODO :
[-] SELECT, FROM and SHOW
[ ] INSERT
